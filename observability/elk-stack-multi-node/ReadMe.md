## Overview
This Docker Compose setup creates a robust and scalable ELK stack for centralized logging, monitoring, and analysis. It leverages the following components:

* **Elasticsearch:** A distributed search and analytics engine. This setup includes three nodes (elasticsearch-node-1, elasticsearch-node-2, elasticsearch-node-3) for high availability and data redundancy.
* **Logstash:** A server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. This setup includes three nodes (logstash-node-1, logstash-node-2, logstash-node-3).
* **Kibana:** A web interface for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch. This setup includes three nodes (kibana-node-1, kibana-node-2, kibana-node-3) exposed via Traefik.
* **Fleet Server:** A component of Elastic Agent that centralizes the management of Elastic Agents. This setup includes three nodes (fleet-node-1, fleet-node-2, fleet-node-3) exposed via Traefik.
* **Traefik:** Used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to expose Kibana and Fleet Server securely with automatic HTTPS (using mycert resolver, likely Let's Encrypt).
* **Docker Networks:**
  * **web_net:** External network for Traefik and services exposed to the web.
  * **app_net:** Internal network for communication between ELK stack components.
* **Docker Volumes:** Persistent volumes (es1_data, es2_data, es3_data) are used for Elasticsearch data to ensure data persistence across container restarts.
* **Docker Secrets:** Sensitive information like certificates, keys, and service tokens are managed using Docker secrets for enhanced security.
* **Docker Configs:** Configuration files for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana are managed as Docker configs.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying this ELK cluster, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Docker Engine:** Version 20.10.0 or higher.
* **Docker Compose:** Version 1.29.0 or higher (or Docker Compose V2).
* **Traefik:** An existing Traefik instance configured with web_net as an external network and a certificate resolver (e.g., mycert) is assumed for external access.
* **SSL Certificates:** Ensure you have generated or obtained the necessary TLS certificates and keys for Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet Server, and a CA certificate. These should be placed in the secrets/certs directory as specified in the docker-compose.yml.
* **Elasticsearch Keystore:** An Elasticsearch keystore should be pre-created if needed for secure settings.
* **Elasticsearch Service Tokens:** Service tokens for Elasticsearch should be available.
* **Logstash Pipeline Configuration:** Logstash pipelines should be defined in the ./logstash/pipeline directory.

## Deployment
* Clone the repository (if applicable) or create the project structure.
* Certificate create from this file and change it with your name and variables
```bash
instances:
  - name: elasticsearch
    dns:
      - elasticsearch-node-1
      - elasticsearch-node-2
      - elasticsearch-node-3
      - es.monlog.mecan.ir
      - es1.monlog.mecan.ir
      - es2.monlog.mecan.ir
      - es3.monlog.mecan.ir
      - localhost
    ip:
      - 127.0.0.1

  - name: kibana
    dns:
      - kibana-node-1
      - kibana-node-2
      - kibana-node-3
      - localhost
      - kibana.monlog.mecan.ir
      - kibana1.monlog.mecan.ir
      - kibana2.monlog.mecan.ir
      - kibana3.monlog.mecan.ir
    ip:
      - 127.0.0.1

  - name: logstash
    dns:
      - logstash-node-1
      - logstash-node-2
      - logstash-node-3
      - localhost
    ip:
      - 127.0.0.1

  - name: apm-server
    dns:
      - apm-server
      - localhost
    ip:
      - 127.0.0.1

  - name: fleet
    dns:
      - fleet-node-1
      - fleet-node-2
      - fleet-node-3
      - localhost
      - fleet.monlog.mecan.ir
      - fleet1.monlog.mecan.ir
      - fleet2.monlog.mecan.ir
      - fleet3.monlog.mecan.ir
    ip:
      - 127.0.0.1
```
* Populate the `secrets/` directory with your TLS certificates, keys, keystore, and service tokens. with this commands
```bash
# before create certificate check this file 
# change domain for this file
cat setup/instances.yml 

# create certificates
docker compose -f setup-certs-compose.yml up

# after create certificates delete pods
docker compose -f setup-certs-compose.yml down

# check all certificate 
ls secrets

# check certificate with this command
openssl x509  -text -noout -in secrets/certs/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.crt
```
* Create and configure the `.env` file as described above.
* Review and customize the configuration files in `elasticsearch/`, `logstash/`, and `kibana/`.
* Ensure your Traefik instance is running and configured with the `web_net` and a certificate resolver (e.g., mycert).
* From the root directory of this project, deploy the stack using Docker Compose:

```Bash
# run all services
docker compose up -d

# check all containers
docker compose ps
```
**This command will:**
* Create the defined volumes and networks.
* Build (if necessary) and start all services.
* Attach secrets and configs to the respective containers.

## Accessing the Services
Once the services are up and healthy, you can access them via the Traefik-exposed domains:

* **Kibana:** Access Kibana through the subdomain configured in `KIBANA1_SUB_DOMAIN` (e.g., `https://kibana1.monlog.mecan.ir`). You'll be prompted to log in using the `ELASTIC_USERNAME` and `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` from your `.env` file.
* **Elasticsearch:** Elasticsearch nodes are exposed via their subdomains (e.g., `https://es1.monlog.mecan.ir`). You can interact with them using tools like curl or client libraries, providing the `ELASTIC_USERNAME` and `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`.
* **Fleet Server:** Access Fleet Server through the subdomain configured in `FLEET1_SUB_DOMAIN` (e.g.,` https://fleet.monlog.mecan.ir`).

## Health Checks
Each service includes a `healthcheck` definition in the `compose.yml` to ensure proper functioning. You can monitor the health of your services using:

```Bash
docker compose ps
docker compose ps -a
```
Look for the "health" column in the output.

## Troubleshooting
* **Check Docker Logs:** The first step in troubleshooting is to check the logs of the problematic service:

```Bash
docker compose logs <service_name>

# For example: 
docker compose logs elasticsearch-node-1
```
* **Verify `.env` and Config Files:** Double-check that all environment variables in `.env` are correctly set and that your configuration files (.yml, .properties) are properly formatted and contain the correct settings.
* **Network Issues:** Ensure the web_net and app_net are correctly configured and that containers can communicate as expected.
* **Certificate Errors:** If you encounter TLS/SSL errors, verify that your certificates and keys are correctly placed and have the right permissions, and that the paths in `compose.yml` are accurate.
* **Memory Issues:** If containers are crashing or restarting frequently, consider increasing the `ELASTICSEARCH_HEAP` and `LOGSTASH_HEAP` values in your .env file, provided your host has sufficient RAM.
* **Traefik Configuration:** Confirm that your Traefik instance is running and its configuration correctly routes traffic to the ELK services.

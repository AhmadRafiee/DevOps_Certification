## Getting Started
This stack uses Docker Compose's profiles feature. This allows you to selectively run groups of services, optimizing resource usage and simplifying development.

### Understanding Profiles
Each service in `compose.yml` has one or more profiles defined. When you run docker compose up, you specify which profiles to activate. Services without a profiles key are always enabled.

Here are the profiles defined in this `compose.yml`:

  - `observability`: Core services for a functional observability stack (Traefik, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Pushgateway, cAdvisor, Blackbox Exporter, Node Exporter, Loki, Promtail, Tempo). This profile acts as an umbrella for many services.
  - `web`: Includes Traefik (for reverse proxy and ingress management).
  - `monitoring`: Specific to metric collection (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Pushgateway, cAdvisor, Blackbox Exporter, Node Exporter).
  - `logging`: Specific to log collection (Grafana, Loki, Promtail).
  - `visualizations`: Primarily for Grafana.
  - `alerting`: For Alertmanager.
  - `tracing`: Core tracing components (Tempo, Memcached, k6-tracing).
  - `tracing-load`: Specifically for the k6 tracing load generator.

### Running Specific Profiles
To start only a subset of services, use the `--profile` flag:

```Bash
docker compose --profile <profile_name> up -d
```

You can specify multiple profiles to activate more services:

```Bash
docker compose --profile <profile_name_1> --profile <profile_name_2> up -d
```

**Examples:** Start just the core monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Exporters):

```Bash
docker compose --profile monitoring up -d
```

Start just the logging stack (Loki, Promtail, Grafana):

```Bash
docker compose --profile logging up -d
```

Start just the tracing stack (Tempo, Memcached, k6-tracing):

```Bash
docker compose --profile tracing up -d
```

### Running the Full Stack
To bring up all services defined in the `compose.yml`, including Traefik for external access:

```Bash
docker compose --profile web --profile observability up -d
```

Explanation: The `observability` profile activates most components. Adding web ensures Traefik is also started, providing external routing to your dashboards.

### Stopping the Stack
To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes (use with caution, as this removes data):

```Bash
docker compose down -v
```

To stop only the running containers without removing volumes:

```Bash
docker compose down
```

## Core Components & What They Do
This section explains the role of each service in your observability stack.

### Traefik
Traefik acts as a modern Edge Router (reverse proxy and load balancer). It integrates directly with Docker, automatically discovering your services and routing external HTTP/HTTPS requests to them based on labels defined in docker-compose.yml.

  - **Provides:** Ingress for Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Alertmanager, Pushgateway.
  - **Features:** Automated HTTPS with Let's Encrypt (ACME), basic authentication for dashboards.

### Prometheus
Prometheus is a powerful monitoring system that collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts.

  - **Provides:** Time-series metric storage and querying (PromQL).
  - **Collects from:** Node Exporter, cAdvisor, Blackbox Exporter, Pushgateway, Traefik, Grafana, Tempo (via remote write for service graphs).

### Grafana
Grafana is an open-source visualization and analytics platform. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics, logs, and traces, regardless of where they are stored.

  - **Provides:** Interactive dashboards for Prometheus metrics, Loki logs, and Tempo traces.
  - **Integrates with:** Prometheus (for metrics), Loki (for logs), Tempo (for traces).

### Alertmanager
Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications like Prometheus. It dedupes, groups, and routes them to the correct receiver integration (e.g., email, Slack).

  - **Provides:** Centralized alert management and notification.
  - **Integrates with:** Prometheus (as the alert source).

### Pushgateway
Pushgateway is an intermediary service that allows ephemeral and batch jobs to push their metrics to Prometheus. Prometheus then scrapes Pushgateway.

  - **Provides:** A way for short-lived services or scripts to expose metrics.
### cAdvisor, Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter
These are exporters that expose system and service-level metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.

  - **cAdvisor:** Collects and exports resource usage and performance metrics from Docker containers.
  - **Node Exporter:** Collects and exports hardware and OS metrics from the host machine (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network stats).
  - **Blackbox Exporter:** Allows you to probe endpoints over various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP) and exports metrics about their availability and response time. Useful for uptime monitoring.

### Loki & Promtail
Loki is a logging system designed for storing and querying logs. It's built similarly to Prometheus, focusing on indexing metadata (labels) rather than full log content for efficiency. Promtail is its agent.

  - **Loki Provides:** Centralized log storage and a query language (LogQL).
  - **Promtail Provides:** Agent that scrapes logs from local filesystems (e.g., /var/log and Docker container logs) and sends them to Loki.

### Tempo & k6-tracing
Tempo is a distributed tracing backend that stores traces at scale, making them accessible for debugging and performance analysis. It integrates seamlessly with Grafana for visualization. k6-tracing is used here for generating test trace data.

  - **Tempo Provides:** Backend storage and querying for traces (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin, etc.). It also generates service graph metrics sent to Prometheus.
  - **k6-tracing Provides:** A load testing tool capable of generating trace data to simulate application traffic and test Tempo's ingestion.

### Memcached
Memcached is a distributed memory caching system. In this stack, it's typically used by Tempo (and potentially Loki) as a caching layer to improve query performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

## Accessing the Dashboards
Once the services are running, you can access the various dashboards via Traefik. Ensure you have configured your DOMAIN_ADDRESS and respective subdomains in the .env file, and that your DNS points these subdomains to your Docker host's IP address.

  - **Traefik Dashboard:** http://traefik.<YOUR_DOMAIN_ADDRESS> (protected by basic auth)
  - **Prometheus:** http://prometheus.<YOUR_DOMAIN_ADDRESS>
  - **Grafana:** http://grafana.<YOUR_DOMAIN_ADDRESS>
    - **Default Credentials:** admin / admin-password (from your .env file)
  - **Alertmanager:** http://alert.<YOUR_DOMAIN_ADDRESS>
  - **Pushgateway:** http://push.<YOUR_DOMAIN_ADDRESS>

---

## Troubleshooting
  - Connection Refused or Unimplemented Service errors:
    - Ensure all containers are Up using `docker ps`.
    - Check container logs (`docker logs <container_name>`) for startup errors.
    - Verify port mappings and network connectivity between services in docker-compose.yml.
    - **Crucially:** Ensure your client applications (e.g., `k6-tracing`) are pointing to the correct internal service name and port for Tempo. For OTLP gRPC, this is usually `tempo:9200` as configured in your `tempo.yaml` `server.grpc_listen_port`. `k6-tracing`'s ENDPOINT environment variable needs to reflect this.
  - Datasource prometheus was not found in Grafana:
    - Go to Grafana -> Connections -> Data sources.
    - Confirm a Prometheus data source named prometheus exists.
    - Verify its URL is `http://prometheus:9090` (assuming Prometheus service name is prometheus).
    - Click "Save & test" to confirm connectivity.
  - `Permission Denied` errors for volumes:
    - Ensure the host directories mapped to container volumes (e.g., ./prometheus, ./loki, ./tempo, ./grafana) have the correct permissions for the user running the Docker containers. You might need to sudo chown -R <user>:<group> <directory> or chmod -R 777 <directory> (use 777 with caution for temporary debugging only).
  - ACME (Let's Encrypt) issues for Traefik:
    - Check Traefik logs for ACME-related errors.
    - Ensure your ACME_EMAIL is valid.
    - Verify your `DOMAIN_ADDRESS` and subdomains are correctly configured in DNS and point to the host running Traefik.

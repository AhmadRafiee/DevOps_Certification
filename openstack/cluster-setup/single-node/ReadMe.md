# Install single-node Openstack cluster
To install a single-node OpenStack environment based on Debian using Kolla-Ansible, you can follow these steps:

#### Set up the Environment:
Install the required packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-dev python3-pip libffi-dev gcc libssl-dev git
```

#### Install Docker:
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect.

#### Clone the Kolla-Ansible repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible.git
cd kolla-ansible
```

#### Install the required Python packages:
```bash
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Install Ansible. Kolla Ansible requires at least Ansible 2.10 and supports up to 4.
```bash
pip install 'ansible>=6,<7'
```

#### Install kolla-ansible and its dependencies using pip.
```bash
pip install git+https://opendev.org/openstack/kolla-ansible@stable/zed
```

#### Generate the Configuration Files:
Copy the globals.yml and passwords.yml sample files:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kolla
sudo chown $USER:$USER /etc/kolla
sudo cp -r etc/kolla /etc/
sudo cp -r etc/kolla/passwords.yml /etc/kolla/
```

#### Generate the Kolla-Ansible configuration file:
```bash
kolla-genpwd
```

#### Configure the Deployment:
Edit the /etc/kolla/globals.yml file:
- Set kolla_internal_vip_address to the IP address of your server.
- Set network_interface to the network interface name.
- Set docker_registry to the registry location (e.g., docker.io).
- Set openstack_release to the desired OpenStack release (e.g., victoria).
- Customize other settings as needed.

Edit /etc/kolla/passwords.yml and set the desired passwords for different services.


#### Run kolla-ansible project and create openstack service
```bash
# generate all passwords with this commands
kolla-genpwd

# pull all images
kolla-ansible -i ansible/inventory/all-in-one pull

# bootstraping server with this command
kolla-ansible -i ansible/inventory/all-in-one bootstrap-servers

# create all certificates with this commands
kolla-ansible -i ansible/inventory/all-in-one certificates

# run prechecks task
kolla-ansible -i ansible/inventory/all-in-one prechecks

# deploy kolla ansible project
kolla-ansible -i ansible/inventory/all-in-one deploy

# run all post deploy tasks
kolla-ansible -i ansible/inventory/all-in-one post-deploy

# run all check tasks
kolla-ansible -i ansible/inventory/all-in-one check
```



#### Deploy OpenStack:
Run the deployment command:
```bash

```

#### Verify the Installation:
Once the deployment is complete, you can verify the installation by accessing OpenStack services through their respective endpoints.
The Horizon dashboard is available at http://<server-ip>/horizon.
Use the admin user and the password defined in /etc/kolla/passwords.yml to log in.
You can create projects, users, networks, instances, and manage other OpenStack resources through the dashboard or using the OpenStack APIs.
Note: This is a basic guide for installing a single-node OpenStack environment using Kolla-Ansible. It's essential to refer to the official Kolla-Ansible documentation for more detailed instructions and additional configuration options based on your specific requirements.

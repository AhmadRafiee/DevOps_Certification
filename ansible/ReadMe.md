### Installation ansible on Debian

#### Install dependencies and configure Ansible Repository
Install ansible dependencies by running the following apt command,
```bash
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
```
Once the dependencies are installed then configure PPA repository for ansible, run
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
```
Now update repository by running beneath apt command.
```bash
sudo apt update
```

#### Install latest version of ansible
Now we are ready to install latest version of Ansible on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / 21.04, run following command.
```bash
sudo apt install -y ansible
```
After the successful installation of Ansible, verify its version by executing the command

```bash
ansible --version
```
Great, above output confirms that Ansible version 2.9.6 is installed.



### Directory Structure:
 To create a role using the ansible-galaxy command, we can simply use the below syntax in our terminal:
```bash
ansible-galaxy init <ROLE_NAME>
# for example
ansible-galaxy init nginx
```


### Simple Modules
Ping hosts
```bash
ansible <HOST_GROUP> -m ping
# for example
ansible localhost -m ping
```
Display gathered facts
```bash
ansible <HOST_GROUP> -m setup | less
# for example
ansible localhost -m setup | less
```
Filter gathered facts
```bash
ansible <HOST_GROUP> -m setup -a "filter=ansible_distribution*"
# for example
ansible localhost -m setup -a "filter=ansible_distribution*"
```

Copy SSH key manually
```bash
ansible <HOST_GROUP> -m authorized_key -a "user=root key='ssh-rsa AAAA...XXX == root@hostname'"
# for example
ansible localhost -m authorized_key -a "user=root key='ssh-rsa AAAA...XXX == root@hostname'"
```

### Limit to one or more hosts
This is required when one wants to run a playbook against a host group, but only against one or more members of that group.

Limit to one host
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --limit "host1"
```
Limit to multiple hosts
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --limit "host1,host2"
```
Negated limit. NOTE: Single quotes MUST be used to prevent bash interpolation.
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --limit 'all:!host1'
```
Limit to host group
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --limit 'group1'
```

### Limiting Tasks with Tags
Limit to all tags matching install
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --tags 'install'
```
Skip any tag matching sudoers
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --skip-tags 'sudoers'
```

### Check for bad syntax
One can check to see if code contains any syntax errors by running the playbook.

Check for bad syntax:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --syntax-check
```

### Running a playbook in dry-run mode
Sometimes it can be useful to see what Ansible might do, but without actually changing anything.

One can run in dry-run mode like this:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/PLAYBOOK_NAME.yml --check
```

### Managing files
An ad hoc task can harness the power of Ansible and SCP to transfer many files to multiple machines in parallel. To transfer a file directly to all servers in the [atlanta] group:
```bash
ansible atlanta -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts"
```

The ansible.builtin.file module allows changing ownership and permissions on files. These same options can be passed directly to the copy module as well:
```bash
ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/srv/foo/a.txt mode=600"
ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/srv/foo/b.txt mode=600 owner=mdehaan group=mdehaan"
```

### Install packages
ansible ad hoc command to install packages:
```bash
ansible localhost -a "apt install vim" --become
ansible all -i hosts.yml -a "apt install vim" --become
ansible all -i hosts.yml -m shell -a "apt install vim" --become
```

### ansible fact and filter data
Facts include a large amount of variable data, filter useful data from it.
```bash
ansible all -i inventories/hosts.yml -m setup  -a "filter=ansible_os_family"
ansible all -i inventories/hosts.yml -m setup  -a "filter=ansible_nodename"
ansible all -i inventories/hosts.yml -m setup  -a "filter=ansible_interfaces"
ansible all -i inventories/hosts.yml -m setup  -a "filter=ansible_lsb"
ansible all -i inventories/hosts.yml -m setup  -a "filter=ansible_memory_mb"
ansible all -i inventories/hosts.yml -m setup  -a "filter=ansible_processor_vcpus"
```

### Managing services
Ensure a service is started on all webservers:
```bash
ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.service -a "name=httpd state=started"
```
Alternatively, restart a service on all webservers:

```bash
ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.service -a "name=httpd state=restarted"
```
Ensure a service is stopped:

```bash
ansible webservers -m ansible.builtin.service -a "name=httpd state=stopped"
ansible all -i inventories/hosts.yml -m service -a 'name=nginx state=started'
ansible all -i inventories/hosts.yml -a 'systemctl status nginx'
```


### Simple Ansible Hosts File Example (hosts)
```bash
# Define individual hosts
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.20

# Define a group of hosts
[webservers]
web1 ansible_user=ubuntu
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 ansible_user=ubuntu

[databases]
db1 ansible_user=root
db2 ansible_host=192.168.1.21 ansible_user=root

# Define multiple groups under one larger group
[production:children]
webservers
databases

# Add specific variables for a group
[webservers:vars]
ansible_port=22
ansible_connection=ssh

[databases:vars]
ansible_port=22
ansible_connection=ssh
```

**Explanation of the Example**
  - Individual Hosts:
      - web1 and db1 are individual hosts with their ansible_host specified (the IP address or DNS name).
      - The ansible_user specifies the user to connect as.
  - Groups:
    - [webservers] and [databases] are groups of hosts. Groups allow you to apply tasks to multiple hosts at once.
    - Hosts web1, web2, db1, and db2 are part of these groups.
  - Group Variables:
    - [webservers:vars] and [databases:vars] specify variables that apply to all hosts in the webservers and databases groups.
    - Variables such as ansible_port and ansible_connection define how Ansible should connect to the hosts.
  - Children Groups:
    - [production:children] groups together other groups (webservers and databases) under a larger group named production.
    - This allows you to easily run playbooks against all servers in the production environment.


### Complex Example with Additional Features

```bash
# Hosts with dynamic variables
appserver1 ansible_host=app1.mydomain.com ansible_user=deploy ansible_port=2222
appserver2 ansible_host=app2.mydomain.com ansible_user=deploy ansible_port=2222

# Group with multiple hosts
[appservers]
appserver1
appserver2

# Nested groups
[production:children]
appservers

# Global variables (apply to all hosts)
[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

# Host patterns (excluding appserver1)
[production:!appserver1]
```

**Explanation of the Complex Example**
  - Dynamic Host Variables:
    - appserver1 and appserver2 are defined with dynamic host variables like ansible_host, ansible_user, and ansible_port.
  - Nested Groups:
    - The [production:children] group includes the appservers group.
  - Global Variables:
    - [all:vars] sets global variables that apply to all hosts in the inventory, like the SSH key and Python interpreter.
  - Host Patterns:
    - [production:!appserver1] uses a pattern to target all hosts in the production group except for appserver1.


### General Pattern for Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands
```bash
ansible <hosts> -m <module> -a "<module_options>" [-i <inventory>] [-u <user>] [--become] [--check]
```
**Breakdown of the Pattern**
  - <hosts>: Specifies the target hosts or groups on which the command will run. This can be a single host, a group of hosts, or a pattern.
  - -m <module>: Specifies the Ansible module to be used. Modules are the building blocks for performing tasks, such as ping, shell, command, copy, yum, apt, etc.
  - -a "<module_options>": Provides the options or arguments for the module. These vary depending on the module used.
  - -i <inventory>: (Optional) Specifies the inventory file if not using the default inventory.
  - -u <user>: (Optional) Specifies the SSH user to connect as. If omitted, Ansible will use the current user or the default SSH user.
  - --become: (Optional) Specifies that the command should be run with elevated privileges (e.g., using sudo).
  - --check: (Optional) Runs the command in "dry-run" mode to see what changes would be made without actually making them.

**Examples of Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands**
```bash
# Ping All Hosts
ansible all -m ping

# Check Disk Space on a Specific Group of Servers
ansible webservers -m shell -a "df -h"

# Install a Package Using apt on Debian-Based Systems
ansible all -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" --become

# Restart a Service Using service Module
ansible webservers -m service -a "name=nginx state=restarted" --become

# Gather Facts About All Hosts
ansible all -m setup

# Execute a Command Without Using a Module
ansible all -m command -a "uptime"

# Add a User Across Multiple Servers
ansible all -m user -a "name=deploy state=present" --become

# Running Ad-Hoc Commands with Privilege Escalation
ansible all -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" --become
```

### Example of Using Ansible Facts in a Playbook

```yaml
---
- name: Gather and use Ansible facts
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Display the operating system
      debug:
        msg: "The operating system is {{ ansible_os_family }}"

    - name: Display the IP address of the default interface
      debug:
        msg: "The default interface IP address is {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"

    - name: Display the total memory in MB
      debug:
        msg: "Total memory: {{ ansible_memtotal_mb }} MB"

    - name: Display the Threads per Core
      debug:
        msg: "Threads per Core: {{ ansible_processor_threads_per_core }}"

    - name: Display Total CPU
      debug:
        msg: "Total CPU Count: {{ ansible_processor_vcpus }}"

    - name: Display all mounted filesystems
      debug:
        msg: "{{ ansible_mounts }}"
```
**Explanation of the Playbook**
  - **gather_facts: yes:** This ensures that Ansible gathers facts about the remote system before executing tasks. This is enabled by default in most cases.
  - **ansible_os_family:** This fact contains the name of the OS family (e.g., RedHat, Debian, etc.). It’s used to determine which package to install (httpd for RedHat-based systems and apache2 for Debian-based systems).
  - **ansible_default_ipv4.address:** This fact holds the IP address of the primary network interface.
  - **ansible_hostname:** This is the hostname of the remote system, which is used to create a unique directory.
  - **ansible_memtotal_mb:** This fact provides the total memory in megabytes, which is displayed using the debug module.
  - **ansible_mounts:** This is a complex fact that lists all mounted filesystems, which is also displayed using the debug module.

**To run this playbook, you would use the following command:**
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts use_facts.yml
```

```

## Expected result

Listing containers must show one container running and the port mapping as below:
```
$ docker compose ps
NAME                COMMAND             SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
flask-web-1         "python3 app.py"    web                 running             0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser or run:
```
$ curl localhost:8000
Hello World!
```

Stop and remove the containers
```
$ docker compose down
```

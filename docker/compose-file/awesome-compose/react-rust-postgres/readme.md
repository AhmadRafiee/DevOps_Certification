## Compose sample application

### Use with Docker Development Environments

You can open this sample in the Dev Environments feature of Docker Desktop version 4.12 or later.

[Open in Docker Dev Environments <img src="../open_in_new.svg" alt="Open in Docker Dev Environments" align="top"/>](https://open.docker.com/dashboard/dev-envs?url=https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/react-rust-postgres)

### React application with a Rust backend and a Postgresql database

Project structure:
```
.
├── backend
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ...
├── compose.yaml
├── frontend
│   ├── ...
│   └── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```

[_compose.yaml_](compose.yaml)
```
services:
  backend:
    build: backend
    ...
  db:
    image: postgres:12-alpine
    ...
  frontend:
    build: frontend
    ports:
    - 3000:3000
    ...
```
The compose file defines an application with three services `frontend`, `backend` and `db`.
When deploying the application, docker compose maps port 3000 of the frontend service container to port 3000 of the host as specified in the file.
Make sure port 3000 on the host is not already being in use.

## Deploy with docker compose

```
$ docker compose up -d
Creating network "react-rust-postgres_default" with the default driver
Building backend
...
Successfully tagged react-rust-postgres_frontend:latest
WARNING: Image for service frontend was built because it did not already exist. To rebuild this image you must use `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up --build`.
Creating react-rust-postgres_frontend_1 ... done
Creating react-rust-postgres_db_1       ... done
Creating react-rust-postgres_backend_1  ... done
```

## Expected result

Listing containers must show three containers running and the port mapping as below:
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES

```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to get a colorful message.

## Install Terraform

**Update Your System**
First, update your package list and install any available upgrades:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Install Required Dependencies**
While Terraform is a standalone binary, it's good practice to have curl or wget installed:

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl unzip
```

**Download Terraform**
Visit the Terraform downloads page to get the latest version's URL, or you can use the command line to download it directly. Replace VERSION with the desired Terraform version (e.g., 1.5.0):

```bash
# get latest version on https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/
# wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/VERSION/terraform_VERSION_linux_amd64.zip
# For example:
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.11.2/terraform_1.11.2_linux_amd64.zip
```

**Unzip the Downloaded File:**
Unzip the downloaded ZIP file:

```bash
unzip terraform_1.11.2_linux_amd64.zip
```

**Move the Binary to a Directory in Your PATH**
Move the Terraform binary to /usr/local/bin so that you can execute it from anywhere in the terminal:

```bash
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
```

**Verify the Installation**
You can verify that Terraform was installed correctly by checking its version:

```bash
terraform version
```

**Clean Up**
You can delete the ZIP file after installation to save space:

```bash
rm terraform_VERSION_linux_amd64.zip
```

## Docker scenario: sample web container

Change `main.tf` and variables.tf on `docker-provider/nginx-sample` directory

```bash
cat docker-provider/nginx-sample/main.tf
provider "docker" {
  host = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
}

resource "docker_container" "MeCan" {
  name     = var.container_name
  image    = var.container_image
  hostname = var.container_hostname
  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}

cat docker-provider/nginx-sample/variables.tf
variable "container_image" {
  type        = string
  default     = "nginx:alpine"
  description = "Docker image for container"
}
variable "container_name" {
  type        = string
  default     = "nginx-mecan"
  description = "Container Name"
}
variable "container_hostname" {
  type        = string
  default     = "MeCan"
  description = "Container hostname"
}
```

**Initialize Terraform**
Before creating resources, you need to initialize Terraform, which will install the necessary provider plugins.

```bash
cd docker-provider/nginx-sample
terraform init
```

**Plan the Deployment**
You can run the plan command to see the actions Terraform will take without actually applying them:

```bash
terraform plan
```

**Apply the Configuration**
To create the container, run:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt you to confirm the action. Type yes to proceed.

**Verify the Container**
You can verify that your Docker container is running by using the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```
You should see the `nginx-mecan` container listed.

**Cleanup**
When you're done and want to remove the resources created by Terraform, you can run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
Again, Terraform will prompt you to confirm that you want to delete these resources. Type yes to proceed.
